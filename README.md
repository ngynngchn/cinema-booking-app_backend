## Cinema Ticket Booking App

This project is a web application that allows users to book tickets for a movie theater. The app provides an overview of available seats in a cinema hall, with seats color-coded to indicate whether they are occupied or available. Users can click on available seats to select them, and the app displays the total cost of the selected seats. The cinema hall has two sections, Premium and Regular, which have different prices.

### Features

- Color-coded seats: Occupied seats are displayed in one color, while available seats are displayed in another.
- Seat selection: Users can click on an available seat to select it, and the app displays the selected seats and their total cost.
- Premium and Regular: The cinema hall is divided into two sections, which have different prices.
- Email notification: When a user books a ticket, an email is sent to the admin with a message indicating which seats were booked and how much revenue was generated.
- Dashboard: The dashboard displays all relevant information about the cinema hall, including the number of available seats, the total revenue, and buttons to create a new cinema hall or reset the current one.
